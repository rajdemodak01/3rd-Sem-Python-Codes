#The code below assigns the 5th letter of each word in 'food' to the new list fifth. However, the code currently produces errors. Insert a #try/except clause that will allow the code to run and produce a list of the 5th letter in each word. If the word is not long enough, it #should not print anything out. Note: The 'pass' statement is a null operation; nothing will happen when it executes.
